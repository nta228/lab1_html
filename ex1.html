<P>A web page is not a printed page. That is, the guidelines that are applied to print may<Br>
    apply to a web page. Avoid making the reader scan too much of the screen while reading the<Br>
    page. After a while it puts a strain on the eyes, and the reader may lose interest. Text should<Br>
    be contained within a few inches width.</P>
<br>
<A name = Consistency>Linear Layout</A>
<P>Linear layout follows a linear structure. There is a sequential link between the pages. Each<br>
    page has a link to the previous and next page. The last page has a link to the first page. This<Br>
    format is used when you are presenting sequential information. For example, chapters of a<Br>
    book or slides of a presentation which require the user to read the information in sequential<Br>
    order.</P>

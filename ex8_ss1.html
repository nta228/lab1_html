<P> The Internet is a network of networks. That is,
    computer networks are linked to other networks, spanning
    countries and today the globe. The TCP/IP transfer protocol
    provides the bindings that connect all these computers the
    world over.

<BR>
<P> Hyper Text Markup Language is the standard
    language that the Web uses for creating and recognizing
    documents. Although not a subset of, it is loosely related
    to the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). SGML is
    a method for representing document formatting languages.

<A name = Consistency>Unity and Variety</A>
<BR>
<P> A basic rule is that of unity and variety. That
    is, everything should fit together as a unit, but at the
    same time there is enough variety to keep things
    interesting. Consistency creates and reinforces the unique
    identity of a site. Colors, fonts, column layout and other
    design elements should be consistent throughout every
    section of the site.
